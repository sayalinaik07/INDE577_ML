**Description**</br>

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction in large datasets. It is an unsupervised learning method that involves transforming the original features of a dataset into a smaller set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. These principal components are obtained by finding the directions of maximum variance in the dataset.

The goal of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining as much of the original information as possible. This is achieved by selecting the top principal components that account for most of the variance in the data.

PCA can be used for various purposes such as data compression, data visualization, and feature extraction. It is widely used in various fields such as finance, image processing, and bioinformatics, to name a few. By reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, PCA makes it easier to analyze and visualize large datasets, and helps to identify important patterns and relationships within the data.

## K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering and identifying patterns in data. The algorithm groups similar data points into a specified number of clusters (k) based on the distance between the data points.

The elbow method is a technique used to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) to use in K-means clustering. It involves plotting the values of the objective function (also known as the within-cluster sum of squares) for different values of k and observing the “elbow point” on the plot. The elbow point is the point where the change in the within-cluster sum of squares begins to level off, indicating that adding more clusters doesn't significantly improve the performance of the algorithm. This technique can be used to find the optimal number of clusters for a particular dataset.
